1. First make a build directory and a data directory
    mkdir build
    mkdir data

2. Build entire software
    ant

3. Generate a Tag family file. Ex. TagCustom20h1.java. Make sure it's located in src/april/tag
    java -cp april.jar april.tag.TagFamilyGenerator custom_bbwwbwwwbwwwwwwbwwwbwwddddddwwwwdbbbbdwwbwdbwwbdbwwbdbwwbdwbwwdbbbbdwwwwddddddwwbwwwbwwwwwwbwwwbwwbb 1

4. Build again
    ant
   Makre sure that there is a .class file located in the build/april/tag. Ex. TagCustom20h1.class

5. Generate markers
    java -cp april.jar april.tag.GenerateTags april.tag.TagCustom20h1 data

    The image that gets generated is super tiny. I wrote a resize.sh to rescale the images. 
    To run it: sh resize.sh
    Make sure you modify the path to be where your .png files are located.

6. Generate C code.
   java -cp april.jar april.tag.TagToC april.tag.TagCustom20h1

   After running this, a .c and .h file will be added. Ex. tagCustom20h1.h and tagCustom20h1.c
   The C code is only used for detection. It specifies the decoding order for a certain tag family.
   You need to copy the both .c and .h file to apriltag/ directory and put #include <TagCustom20h1.h>
   in the .c or .cpp file that you would like to build.
